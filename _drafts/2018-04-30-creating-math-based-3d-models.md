One of my clients requested a longer form 3-D Printing class that needed a tangible immediate benefit present when participants went to the class. One of the ideas that came up was to use mathematical formulas to create 3-D objects. The goal was to be able to show every day tangible benefits to knowing math and 3D printing and using it in an artistic fashion. <!--excerpt-->

Research was started by looking for math based art examples. One artist in particular that popped up was <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/hamid-naderi-yeganeh/"> Hamid Naderi Yeganeh </a> and he was featured in Scientific American. His methodology created gorgeous mathematics but the application was a bit out of our target demographic.

Let's bring it back to the priorities of the project:
* Applied math, art, and 3D printing
* Low budget
* K-6 education market
	* Ease of use
	* Accessible
	* Practicable away from the teaching site
	* Quick Feedback
* Usable on Linux

As the target audience has no background in programming I wanted to find a tool that did most of the math-> computer language  heavy lifting as we wanted this class to be done over 6 sessions and teaching how to code was not in the scope of work nor what the end user would want to work with. I kept researching along the lines of graphing math for educators and came across this tool called <a href="https://www.desmos.com/">DESMOS</a> and specifically it's calculator tool. 

This tool was great, we could use it to make rudimentary math based 2-D drawings using the slope intercept form y=mx+b or quadratic equations or trigonometric functions. We can teach these fundamental tools to make 3-dimensional objects treating the formulas like paintbrushes. It works in parametric or polar forms and you can have both mathematical models projected upon one another. The only "problem" we had was that it would not generate a CAD friendly format. Luckily, the software had the ability to export an image with just the function without the axes or markings and I had experience turning raster images into svgs and then svgs into dxfs via a litle program called inkscape.
