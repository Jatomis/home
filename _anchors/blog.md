"description": " <p>Just as I am listening to music on my phone, I am reminded just how much of life is plastered behind a glass pane. We don’t realize we can reach out and change what is playing on the screen. We are reminded of what we cannot change when we yell at the next victim in a horror movie to not go down that dark corridor and yet they do it anyways. Our words are powerless. As we watch the the horror unfold, we are subjected to our own horror.</p> <p>The horror of believing we have no impact on the world. Immovable giants moving the cogs of inevitability. Every so often we see the ragged edges of the monolith, where our minds can grow like the lichen on an unpolished granite face.</p> <p>As we are too busy building up the scaffolding of our life from that patch of unpolished granite, we polish the life out of the walls. The polish, while making the wall beautiful, sanitizes it, streamlines it and does not encourage the roots of human consciousness. The questions that we seek answers to, we polish them away on our way up, and it makes it harder for others to follow. It makes it harder for others to make their own dent in the world.</p> <p>Seek out the imperfections, dig at them with glee. But leave along a story so someone else can see. For if you leave some grit, some roughness in your approach. Someone else will follow, fertile land to grow.</p> <p>If you make it perfect, there is nothing to be done. You’ve paved the road to the peak, the wanderings obsolete.</p> <p>So when something bugs you, please recognize the need. The world has just given you an opportunity indeed. You may not get riches in the conventional way you seek, but it is your quest — should you choose to accept. In 60 seconds this message will expire. For that is how long it takes to forget a desire.</p> <p>Written September 30, 2017</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=29717a7991e3" width="1" height="1" alt=""> "

"description": " <p>Sometimes when I am at home with a little extra time, I have the urge to make something. Often times either before I have started work or while I am in the middle of working on it, my brain starts going and it asks a question about what it is I am doing. Something along the lines of this: “Why are you doing this? There are so many people who do this better than you. You are just making garbage.” Even when it is a novel idea that aims to solve a problem through a product, it goes: you are just making more trash that the world will throw away. It is hard thinking like that when you want your work to have net positive impact to the world. It is very easy to give up and this sometimes causes your mind to wander and consider suicide.</p> <p>Sometimes when you want to do the best, it is hard to face that your best is not perfect. Where you can imagine how something is <em>supposed</em> to be and yet how far it is from your mind’s eye. Whether it is a physical, mental, or social creation. And then you think: Why can I imagine it if it is so far away? Why do I believe I can do it perfectly when thus far, everything I have done has fallen short?</p> <p>Here is where we ask the people who have come before us, whether in person or through story and they answer with well-polished platitudes about not to worry about perfection or don’t compare yourself to others or it is about the journey, not the destination. The only thing you can claim is the work. The ones who first refined these thoughts like black river rocks, knew because they ran into this themselves. They know how true their statements were and how completely unsatisfactory the answer was to one striving for perfection.</p> <p>The completeness and incompleteness of these platitudes is testament to this seemingly fundamental nature to the human condition.</p> <p>So it is okay to make garbage. The alternative is that you haven’t made anything and someone else will do the work you gave up on, spending their time to catch up to your mistakes and it will still be garbage.</p> <p>Written December 2, 2017</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3d89a257e81" width="1" height="1" alt=""> "

"description": " <p>Some of this writing stretches all the way back to 2013 and I have never had the fortitude to publish them as I was too afraid to put my voice out in the world.

I am at a point in my life where if I don’t do this, I will regret it. There are a lot of things I don’t know and are completely unaware of, but there are a lot of things I do know and I haven’t shared them. Plus there are a lot of things I was going through that I felt that I could not communicate about because of NDA’s and the feeling that if I said anything, the whole project would go belly up.

"description": " <p>I want to write. I don’t know if it will mean anything to anyone else, but I feel there is nothing I can offer through my words. There is nothing new in the world and I feel like a mouthpiece for the great ones I studied before me. I am torn between saying what I want to say and simply referring to the greats who have made my point already for me. I’m sure many of you may feel the same way. In the words of Blurryface “I wish I found some better sounds no one’s ever heard I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words”</p> <p>Or, In the words of the Bible:</p> <p>“The Sea of Galilee receives, but does not keep the Jordan. For every drop that flows into, another drop flows out. The Sea of Galilee gives equally as it receives.</p> <p>But the Dead Sea keeps the Jordan. It has no outlet. Every drop it gets, it keeps. It is not tempted to share and stockpiles its incoming waters aggressively.”</p> <p>You may be familiar with this parable and many permutations upon it:</p> <p>“The one who learns the best teaches others”, “It is better to give than to recieve” And thus, today I write.</p> <p>You may think that writers write for the betterment of everyone else, to spread the body of knowledge for ages far in the future to understand. I do it because I feel that I am selfish.</p> <p>It is through this “Guilt?” that I wish to rid myself of, that I choose to write. Perverse this selfless selfishness, I am sure many of you are familiar with. We write so that our perspective, experiences and trials be a marker for those who come after us, guideposts and bumpers in this pinball game we call life but also because these trials hurt. It is much better to have paper remember it for us than to hold it in the neural connections that fire repeatedly and endlessly repeat these trials. I wish not to hold it in where I become a rut of my past self, but rather release it so that I may become a different person than the one who wrote these words five minutes ago.</p> <p>And so I write, no longer burdened of my intention, my selfishness and vanity. Because I know I am, you know I am and I need not hide it or be upset about it or wish it away. I only need to look at it because I have let the world remember my follies instead of I.</p> <p>I can work on being braver knowing why I write. Not because of you, but because of me. Because of my flaws, because of my anxiety. And if it helps you dear Reader, Writer, Actor, Being, all the better.</p> <img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f0608c80dc53" width="1" height="1" alt=""> "
