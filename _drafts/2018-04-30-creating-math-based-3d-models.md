One of my clients requested a longer form 3-D Printing class that needed a tangible immediate benefit present when participants went to the class. One of the ideas that came up was to use mathematical formulas to create 3-D objects. The goal was to be able to show every day tangible benefits to knowing math and 3D printing and using it in an artistic fashion. <!--excerpt-->

Research was started by looking for math based art examples. One artist in particular that popped up was ____ and he was featured in scientific american. His methodology was to use a program like matlab or mathematica. 

Let's bring it back to the priorities of the project:
* Applied math, art, and 3D printing
* Low budget
* K-6 education market
	* Ease of use
	* Accessible
	* Practicable away from the teaching site
	* Quick Feedback
* Usable on Linux

As the target audience has no background in programming I wanted to find a tool that did most of the math-> computer language  heavy lifting as we wanted this class to be done over 6 sessions and teaching how to code was not in the scope of work nor what the end user would want to work with.
