Welcome, this website is a collection of thoughts and ideas I have had as I work on multiple projects. The end goal is to have a personal library of work upon which I can reference in the future, a repository that will act as my Curriculum Vitae, as well as provide value to the people who read what I have written here. Many of the posts will be syndicated to other platforms but here will be the main hub for all content I post on the web. Try as I might to focus my interest on one body of knowledge, I am not wired to simply be content with one field of research. Thus, you will see here topics ranging from security, both in the physical sense and digital sense, art, fashion, technology, manufacturing, psychology, engineering, coding, motorcycles, marketing. I have done all this research to fix problems I have encountered and hope that what you read here will be useful to you.

For those of you who are interested in what I do professionally:

I have assisted with creating technology and curriculum for Stevenson Design and Consulting Solutions, Petception, KIGT Inc, Pavana Indian Hair, Not for Sale Clothing, Be A Maker Club, iMicromed, Chargerhelp and GLabs. My experience in working with testing labs as well as manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing, machining, injection molding, casting, electronics, computers, programming and marketing can help bring your idea to reality. My consultancy has developed a way to atomize the design process to make it easier for customers to understand and budget in such a way to scale up from the most rudimentary concept all the way up to a fully-detailed design, click here:
